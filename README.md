# Yet another compiler

This is a course project for Compilers' Principles, Tongji University.

We aim to make a compiler that translates ansi c codes into mips assembly.

## Progress

Currently we've implemented the front-end, including a lexical analyzer, a parser that analyzes LR(1) grammar and a semantics analyzer.

We use lex specification and grammar from this website. [ANSI C Yacc Grammar](https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y.html)

This projet is still in progress.
